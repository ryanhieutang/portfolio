                <p class="project-desc">Cal-ch is a user friendly lazy calculator also known as Calculator Couch. This project was built using HTML, CSS and JS showcasing my knowledge on glassmorphism.<br><br>It featured basic math functionalities through logical pieces of code and acts just like a standard calculator on your Mac or PC.

                <p class="project-desc">This landing page was one of my first commercial projects as a full stack developer! Programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS were used to build this website and I used AOS, a nifty animation library to get the job done.<br><br>This landing page was split up into seven components : the hero, about, testimonials, prices, faq, twitter success, and footer.

                <h2 class="project-title">Discord Server Statistics</h2>
                <p class="project-desc">This project targets a major problem within Discord, which is the ability to customise the aesthetics of the channel names where the stats are displaying. This was coded purely using Javascript which I think is a strong point when working with Discord's API (discord.js), and is easily configured by the viewers.<br><br>The features of this project includes the ability to keep track of total users, online users, and users with a certain role(s) through the manipulation of the channel's name.
